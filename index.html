      Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in
      2001. Our products are used by a community of dedicated musicians, sound
      designers, and artists from across the world.

      Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when
      you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
    </p>
    <p class="p4">
      We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force
      behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it
      for.

    <p class="p5">Why Ableton - Juanpe Bolivar</p>
    <p class="p6">
      We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between
      our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
    </p>
    <p class="p7">
      Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
      Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
      professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and
      most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief
      that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something
      big: helping to shape the future of music culture.
    </p>

    <p class="p8">
       We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great</p>
    <p class="p9">
      Rather than adding features, we solve problems. With Push, we’ve set out
      to make something that deeply respects the relationship between musician
      and computer. With Live, we have far more users than we did when we
      started, but we’ve managed to stay close to our users. This has allowed us
      to create something that people from a wide range of musical genres
      appreciate.</p>
      <img src="/32Bit_2.jpg" alt="img" class="img6" />
      <p class="p10">We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally passionate about improving who we are.</p>
      <p class="p11">We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>
      <p class="p12">Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

      <p class="p13">We want our employees to love it here. Since we’re looking for exceptional talent from around the world, we will do everything we can to make your transition as easy as possible.</p>
      <p class="p14">If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
      <div class="block4">
        <p class="p15">We’re really proud of the work we’ve done so far. But there’s so much more to come. If you’d like to be a part of it, please join us.</p>
